Tetris
======

Clone of the famous game Tetris made in Java using applets and timers. This was not a part of any coursework but was just a challenge I gave myself. I also made a screencast while writing the code. You can watch the video here (http://youtu.be/JGQ_lOaeki4). The first three minutes are the three hours that took me to make this game. The rest is just me playing the game.
